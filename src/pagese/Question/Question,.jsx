      <h4>What is eLearning?</h4>
      <p>
        To put it simply, eLearning is electronic learning, and it typically
        includes a combination of electronic media and educational technology.
        E-learning is computer based and makes use of multimedia sources such as
        text, audio, animations, images and so on. It is an intranet or an
        extranet web-based learning that combines information and communication
        systems on either a free standing or network based Learning Management
        System (LMS). E-Learning is synonymous with the use of ICT (information
        and communication technology) in education. Today, eLearning is used
        extensively in the education and the corporate worlds.

      <h4>Why should I consider eLearning-based training?</h4>
      <p>
        E-learning is anywhere learning! Classroom training sessions require
        face to face interaction, which usually takes place during working
        hours, hindering working schedules. With eLearning, you have the freedom
        to to take the course at the place and time of your choice, without
        affecting work schedules. E-learning is pocket friendly and saves time;
        it saves the money spent on printed material and classroom supplies,and
        the best part is that it is cheaper to develop and can be used
        frequently. British Telecom delivered e-business training to 23,000
        employees in three months at a cost of £5.9m, compared to £17.8 million
        and a five-year time span for classroom training (Source: Taylor, 2002).
        So, you can see for yourself why eLearning should be an obvious choice
        for your training needs.

      <h4>Can I earn from eLearning?</h4>
      <p>
        1. Take eLearning Courses To Enhance Your Current Skills The modern
        world demands different skillsets than the ones that were expected a few
        decades ago. ... 2. Get Certified Although certification doesn’t matter
        to some employers, for others (especially companies that receive a large
        number of applications), it’s a big deal.
